""" DropBlock, DropPath

PyTorch implementations of DropBlock and DropPath (Stochastic Depth) regularization layers.

Papers:
DropBlock: A regularization method for convolutional networks (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12890)

Deep Networks with Stochastic Depth (https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09382)

Code:
DropBlock impl inspired by two Tensorflow impl that I liked:
 - https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/blob/master/models/official/resnet/resnet_model.py#L74
 - https://github.com/clovaai/assembled-cnn/blob/master/nets/blocks.py

Image to Patch Embedding using Conv2d

A convolution based approach to patchifying a 2D image w/ embedding projection.

Based on the impl in https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer

    This is the same as the DropConnect impl I created for EfficientNet, etc networks, however,
    the original name is misleading as 'Drop Connect' is a different form of dropout in a separate paper...
    See discussion: https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/issues/494#issuecomment-532968956 ... I've opted for
    changing the layer and argument names to 'drop path' rather than mix DropConnect as a layer name and use
